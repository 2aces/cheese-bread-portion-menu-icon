# Cheese Bread Portion Menu Icon (ícone de menu Porção de Pão de Queijo)

* Para versão em português, [clique aqui](LEIAME.md)

A free for use (and low calories) menu icon for those who love Pão de Queijo (Cheese Bread), a iconic food from Minas Gerais state, Brazil. Created for [Japu - Rotas das Vertentes](https://www.japuapp.com.br/app/) and [licensed under the MIT License.](LICENSE)

## About the icon
The icon represents a portion of Pão de Queijo (Cheese Bread balls), a typical and delicious snack fom Minas Gerais state in Brazil. It was created as humorous homage for celebrating both the first WordPress Meetup at Tiradentes, a small and beautiful town in the state countryside, in the same week of April's fool of 2018, and the city 300 years anniversary. It was inspired by [a 2015 tweet by Luke Wroblewski](https://twitter.com/lukew/status/591296890030915585) and a [follow up by Ramin Nasibov](https://twitter.com/RaminNasibov/status/980481387684859904) kind of joking about "Hamburger Menu" and other food related name for usual icons for apps and websites like "Döner", "Kebab", "Bento" and "Meatballs" menu.

From a UX (User Experience), the icon may not be the best option for menus. But if you want to pay homage to Tiradentes, Minas Gerais, is crazy about Pão de Queijo or just something different, go ahead! Don't forget to send a screenshot of your website or app using the icon for our [Showcase gallery](README.md#showcase).
