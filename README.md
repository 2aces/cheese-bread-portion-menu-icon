## About the icon
The icon represents a portion of Pão de Queijo (Cheese Bread balls), a typical and delicious treat fom Minas Gerais. It was created as a homage to the state culture inspired by [a 2015 tweet by Luke Wroblewski](https://twitter.com/lukew/status/591296890030915585) and a [follow up by Ramin Nasibov](https://twitter.com/RaminNasibov/status/980481387684859904) joking about "Hamburger Menu" and other food related name for usual icons for apps and websites
